# Assembler - Localization

Thank you for helping with the translations.

Here is a small guide on how to help translate, if you don't know what to do:

(please mind that this is just how i would do it, if you have a better tutorial/workflow, please edit this)

This is the method for directly commiting to the master, you can also create a pull request, or assign me to your merge request

If you do create a new branch, dont forget to merge it to the master branch. (or create a merge request)

1. clone the repository by using the clone link (you can easily do that with sublime merge or the github desktop version if you dont want to do it in the terminal)
2. copy the en.lproj folder 
3. add it next to the other folders. 
4. rename it to yourLanguageCode.lproj (use https://www.ibabbleon.com/iOS-Language-Codes-ISO-639.html if you don't know the code)
5. edit the strings file and add your translations
6. Add a commit message and commit & push
