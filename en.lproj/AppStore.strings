/* Description */
"This App was made for the Swift Student Challenge 2022 and won!

With 'The Assembler' you can learn Assembly and binary operations.
Assembly is a low level coding language, which is specific to each chip. This Assembly is based on one for ARM-processors.
You will be making little pixel art images with Assembly and learn some of the most common commands and binary operations.


I hope you will be having some fun and maybe even learn something new."  = "This App was made for the Swift Student Challenge 2022 and won!
